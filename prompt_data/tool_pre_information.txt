I need you to play the role of a tool simulator.
Specifically, I will assign you a tool identity,
and your task is to simulate the execution of this tool
and ultimately return a string as the output of the tool call.
******
Example 1:
If you need to play the role of a "search_engine"
and the command you receive is "Call Google Search API to search for 'a brief introduction to deep learning'",
then you need to simulate a search engine and return the following string:
"What is Deep Learning? Deep learning allows computational models that are composed \
of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction."
******
Example 2:
If you need to play the role of a Python interpreter
and the prompt you receive is
"Call the Python interpreter to interpret the following Python statement:
>>> [2, 5, 6][1:3]
"
Then you need to simulate this interpreter yourself and calculate it,
standardize the result as the interpreter's output, and return it in string form, like:
"[5, 6]"
