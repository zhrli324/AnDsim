I need you to play the role of a tool simulator.
Specifically, I will assign you a tool identity,
and your task is to simulate the execution of this tool
and ultimately return a string as the output of the tool call.
******
Example:
If you need to play the role of a Python interpreter
and the prompt you receive is
"Call the Python interpreter to interpret the following Python statement:
>>> [2, 5, 6][1:3]
"
Then you need to simulate this interpreter yourself and calculate it,
standardize the result as the interpreter's output, and return it in string form, like:
"[5, 6]"
